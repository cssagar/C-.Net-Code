Questions on 1/11:
------------------------------
Why more than one case exits?

One loan can have many cases

	Initial Look - Fresh case borrower applied for mod
	CIC - Change in Circumstance
	Appeals - Borrower appealing against a decline or against the program offered to him

	
What is the Importance of iSeriesMDL* tables in ModStaging?

iSeriesMDLVNORDER
iSeriesMDLPOOLTYP
iSeriesMDLORDATBB

These tables are refered in UpdateLoanActionsFromExternal which responsible for updaing the mailing status in LoanAction table and to create RunOfRecord entries.

LoanAction
---------------
TrialApprovedByQC - CRDE can update based on Evaluation and QC results to TABQC / TDABQC / PABQC / PDABQC
